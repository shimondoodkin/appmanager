ScrollView is a new component, which leverages the 
synthetic gesture layer, normalizing touch and mouse
based input added in 3.2. It also leverages the transitions 
normalization layer added in 3.2 to optimize animation
performance.

3.3.0

* Fixed shared scrollbar node across multiple instances.

* Changed async call to _uiDimensionsChange after render, to a sync call.

* Corrected skin prefix to be yui3-skin-sam instead yui-skin-sam.

* Refactored for kweight, and broke out scrollview-base-ie conditional module.

* Don't prevent default on gesturemoveend, so that click listeners on elements
  inside the scrollview respond reliably. Panning is still prevented by
  preventing gesturemousemove.

* Removed generic CSS in scrollview-base.css targeting UL/LI content. The rules
  were added to support the common use case, but were too broad, and in general,
  scrollview is content agnostic.

  The same support can be achieved by adding cssreset to the page (to remove
  LI bullets, padding, margin), and adding inline block rules, when providing
  horizontal scrollview content as a list. These rules are provided below:

  /* To layout horizontal LIs */
  #my-horiz-scrollview-content li {
     display: inline-block;
     *display: inline;
     *zoom:1;
  }

  /* For IE - needs a non-transparent background to pick up events */
  #my-scrollview-content li {
     *zoom:1;
     background-color:#fff;
  }

* Added prefix-less border radius scrollbar styles for IE9.

* Made scrollbar-paginator skinnable:false. It has no CSS which is applied,
  out of the box currently. The paginator CSS shipped in 3.2.0, was not actively
  applied.

3.2.0

* New beta component
